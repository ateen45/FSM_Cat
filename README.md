# Cat Finite State Machine

This Finite State Machine handles 7 different states:
- Approached
- Away
- Fight
- Play
- Hiss
- Purr
- Sleep

You, the player, interact with the cat by either feeding or petting it to change its mood. The goal is for you to get the cat to trust you so it feels comfortable playing with you. After enough playing, the cat will fall asleep. In this state, you are given a choice to take the cat home. Upon success, you may make it your pet by renaming him.
